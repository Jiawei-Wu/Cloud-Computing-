# Cloud-Computing-Course-Project-AWS-Based-Movie-Recommendation-System
This project aimed to develop a movie recommendation system with Spark ML based on AWS EMR using Zepplin. We try to scale the algorithm so it would be able to handle a data set of 10,000,000 ratings by using Spark ML. This project is implemented based on a model called Collaborative Filtering. It takes a set of movies that have highest ratings and recommending them to the other users who also rated high on them. The root mean squre error (RMSE) is used to represent the deviation between predicted and observed values.
